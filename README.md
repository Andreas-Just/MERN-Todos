# [MERN Todo App](https://todos-with-mern.herokuapp.com/#/)

The most uncreatively titled app of all time.

## Why?

The end goal is to convert/rewrite the Rails backend of my other project [MessageMe](http://github.com/andrewjgregory/MessageMe/) to Node.js as a learning exercise. I decided to write a simple todo app to gain basic familiarity with Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js before diving into more complex features like real-time messaging.

## New Technologies

I love trying new technologies with a new project. Here are the new ones that I am incorporating into this project and why:

- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) because they DRY up code
- [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) to gain knowledge of bootstrap and so I don't spend a lot of time styling this app, since that is not the main purpose
- [Node](https://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to gain knowledge of these rapidly growing technologies
- [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) to memoize redux selectors
- [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) to have some logic of how I name my CSS classes, instead of picking what I think sounds right

## MVPs

### Done

- Sign up, sign in, log out

### Next

- Todo completion status
- Create a todo
- Edit a todo
- Delete a todo

### Bonus

- "Like" other user's todos
- Group todos in folders
- Be able to move todos from one folder to another
- Real time chatting (to get a sense of what the future holds for re-writing the backend of MessageMe)
